  @ means ,@ must come right after

  [a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,15} means allow letters between a-z lowercase and uppercase and numbers,hypens minimum 1 and up to 15 of these characters
  
  \. matches the dot so dot must come after, we escaped dot using a backslash because dot has special meaning in regular expression so we need to escape it after a character class(square brackets)

  [a-zA-Z]{2,10}$  means allow letters between a-z lowercase and uppercase minimum 2 letters and up to 10 letters following $ sign which is a metacharacter in regular expression means that the pattern right before $ sign must appear at the end of the string.
